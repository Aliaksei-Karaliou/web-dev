# Project

During the course students work in groups of two or three on a project of their
choice.

Goal of a project is to acquire practical skills in modern web application
technologies. Domain model should be simplified to a bare minimum, so focus
could be set on technologies rather than complicated domain rules.

## Common Practices

### Occam's razor

Use [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) when defining
project scope. Which means _among many user stories, the one with the fewest
domain rules should be selected._

### Ubiquitous Language

- read https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html
- practice Ubiquitous Language when writing user stories and designing API

## Recommendations

- work on projects in groups of two or three, as it would be most efficient
- model data and mock it to simplify initial implementation
  - i.e. don't be blocked by _complex external API_

# Steps

- define project idea
- write user stories
- outline major terms which would be used in API
- design HTTP API which follows REST architectural style
- implement server API
- implement client
