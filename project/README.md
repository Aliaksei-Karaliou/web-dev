# Project

During the course students work in groups of two or three on a project of their
choice.

Goal of a project is to acquire practical skills in modern web application
technologies. Domain model should be simplified to a bare minimum, so focus
could be set on technologies rather than complicated domain rules.

# Occam's razor

Use [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) when defining
projects scope and implementing it. Which means _among many user stories, the
one with the fewest domain rules should be selected._
